  When you say: We're in a good /Stimmung/, you mean a good psychological tuning, being well tuned together.

* Stimmung, Emacs tuned to inner harmonies

/Stimmung-themes/ is a pair of monoesuqe Emacs themes with minimal syntax highlighting. They are inspired by [[https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster][Tonsky's Alabaster theme]], following the maxim that a theme that highlights everything paradoxically highlights nothing. Text backgrounds (comments, strings and constants) and font variations (definitions/callsites) are used as alternatives to text colors, ensuring a harmonious reading experience. The hues of the /stimmung-dark/ are selected to match the default macOS dark mode. The themes feature a (default golden beige) highlight color that you can set with the variables ~stimmung-themes-light-highlight-color~ and ~stimmung-themes-dark-highlight-color~ respectively.

Emacs packages often define their own faces, making theming a relatively sisyphean task. /Stimmung-themes/ defines all default faces and some of the most common, and uncommon, packages. This includes programming modes like [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]] and [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]], but also things like [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-solaire-mode][solaire]] and productivity/communication modes like [[https://git.notmuchmail.org/git/notmuch][notmuch]] or [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]].

** Installation
[[https://melpa.org/#/stimmung-themes][Stimmung-themes is distributed via MELPA]]. Install it with your package manager of preference (~package.el~, ~straight~, ~use-package~) and make sure the following lines are in your init-file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'stimmung-themes) ; if you use package.el
(stimmung-themes-load-light)
#+END_SRC

A typical use-package installation might look something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package stimmung-themes
  ;; :straight (stimmung-themes :host github :repo "motform/stimmung-themes") ; if you are a straight shooter
  :demand t
  :ensure t
  :config (stimmung-themes-load-light)) ; or (stimmung-themes-load-dark)
#+END_SRC

Note that some faces, like =org-block=, inherit from the =fixed-pitch= font, in order to allow them to properly work with =variable-pitch-mode=. This means that, in order to have a consistent experience, you may have to set the relevant =face-attribute=. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-face-attribute 'default        nil :family "iosevka"            :height fixed-size    :weight 'medium)
(set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch    nil :family "iosevka"            :height fixed-size    :weight 'medium)
(set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Overpass Nerd Font" :height variable-size :weight 'normal)
#+END_SRC

** Customization

You can control the color of the highlight with the following variables.

| variable                              | values          |
|---------------------------------------+-----------------|
| ~stimmung-themes-dark-highlight-color~  | [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Colors.html][any Emacs color]] |
| ~stimmung-themes-light-highlight-color~ | [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Colors.html][any Emacs color]] |

There is also a convenience function to toggle between the dark and light theme, ~stimmung-themes-toggle~.
